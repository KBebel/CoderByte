*  Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArithGeo(arr) take the array of    *
*  numbers stored in arr and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows    *
*  an arithmetic pattern or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. If   *
*  the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic sequence is     *
*  one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a   *
*  geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or     *
*  common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric                        *
*  example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not  *
*  be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.                        *
*                                                                                      *
*  SOLUTION                                                                            *
*  To check for arithmetic pattern, start by getting the difference between the first  *
*  two number. Then loop thru array starting in position 2 and subtract the previous   *
*  number. If the difference is equal to the initial difference then you have an       *
*  arithmetic pattern so return arithmetic. Next repeat by getting initial difference  *
*  by dividing the first and second numbers. Loop through array starting in position   *
*  2 and compare the current number divided by previous number. If difference is       *
*  equal to the initial number then you have a geometric pattern. Else return -1.      *

    flagGeo = "true"
    count = 0
    diffArr = arr[1] - arr[0]
    diffGeo = arr[1]/arr[0]
    while count < (len(arr)-1):
        if diffArr + arr[count] == arr[count+1]:
            print diffArr
            count += 1
            continue
        else:
            flagArr = "false"
            break
    count = 0
    while count < (len(arr)-1):
        if diffGeo * arr[count] == arr[count+1]:
            print diffGeo
            count += 1
